## Forks

If you're forking the repository to develop the project as your own instead of just to send back a PR, follow these steps.

1. Create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with the **repo** scope.
1. Create a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) with the **Name** as `GITHUB_PAT`, and **Value** as the token you created in the previous step.
