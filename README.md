# Prod Backend

_Production-Ready Backend Template_

![Cover](branding/cover.jpg)

For people who need to build backends, Prod Backend is a production-ready backend template. Unlike other templates, this repo has few opinions and isn't bloated.

This template uses Kotlin, ktor, PostgreSQL, Gradle, GitHub Actions, OpenAPI, and Docker. Read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/neelkamath/df9198b13ac344b17938a7909cdb31f2) to learn how to best set up the project.

Branding assets are stored in the [`branding`](branding) directory.

If you want to use a previous version, download and use the `Source code` asset of that particular [release](https://github.com/neelkamath/prod-backend/releases).
